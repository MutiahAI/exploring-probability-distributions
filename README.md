# Exploring-Probability-Distributions
Probability Distributions and Data Analysis


This exercise focuses on using the scipy.stats library to work with probability distributions, and analyzing data using statistical tools. It involve defining functions to calculate probability mass and density, integrating functions using quad, computing convolutions, generating samples from probability distributions, and fitting data to a probability distribution. The data analysis task involves using pandas-datareader library to download stock data from Yahoo Finance and computing daily returns. The exercise requires a good understanding of probability distributions, integrals, and statistical concepts.
