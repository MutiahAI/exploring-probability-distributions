# Exploring-Probability-Distributions
Probability Distributions and Data Analysis


This code focuses on using the scipy.stats library to work with probability distributions, and analyzing data using statistical tools. It involves defining functions to calculate probability mass and density, integrating functions using quad, computing convolutions, generating samples from probability distributions, and fitting data to a probability distribution.
It requires a good understanding of probability distributions, integrals, and statistical concepts.
